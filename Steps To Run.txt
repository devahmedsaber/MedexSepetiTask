Hello Dear,

I will explain some of the parts that I implemented during
the implementation of the task.

1- First i create a laravel plain project.
2- I create a database migrations files for the tables (categories, brands, products).
3- I create a model for every database table.
4- Then i used a Repository Design Patern to handle the code.
5- I made two interfaces for home repository and product repository.
6- I made two repositories for home and product.
7- I made two controllers for home and product.
8- I registered the interfaces with repositories in (RepositoryServiceProvider) file.
9- I made a class to handle the api's responses in (app/classes) directory.
10- I made two Helpers.
11- Helpers.php file is a helper to make an instance from my ResponseBuilder class.
12- Upload.php file is a helper to upload an image.
13- I created two api's for list products with filter (category_id).
14- Second api is to store a product in the database.
15- The product store method used my request (StoreProductRequest) to handle the validation.
16- The (StoreProductRequest) is extend (ApiRequest) class not (FormRequest).
17- I made (ApiRequest) class to handle the validation and transformerd the errors in a json response.
18- The frontend is a page in (views/website/index.blade.php) is a home page.
19- I made a frontend with (html, css, bootstrap, js) and owl carousel plugin.
20- I make .htaccess in root folder to remove 'public' from project url.


I have inserted the database file into the project folder with name (medex_task.sql).
And also i have inserted the Api Collection file into the project folder.


- To run the project after cloning:

1- run 'composer install' in the terminal.
2- create a database with (medex_task) name in phpmyadmin.
3- import the (medex_task.sql) into the database you created.
4- update the env file DB_DATABASE with (medex_task).
5- go to http://localhost/MedexSepetiTask/
6- import the api collection into postman.
7- test the (index, store) api's of the product.

Thank You.
